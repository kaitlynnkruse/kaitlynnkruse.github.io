                <h3>ISU Bike Share</h3>
                <p>The goal for the project is to get a system for scanning ISU cards set up so it pushes and pulls the necessary
                data from the ISU database. We need continue work with the exisitng system to lock/unlock the bike based on the RFID on the bike being read. In addition to refining the RFID reading, there is a priority for a phone application for the users to be able to get real data for bikes available and bike docks open. This will be an important feature to the project because it will allow the users to know where there are bikes or docks available as well as other service tasks. Because this project will have a first trial release in order to continue asking for funds for the ISU Bike Share project, there is a specific need for a lot of analytics. Data needs to be collected for how many bikes are being used at a current time, where the bikes are going, which routes are the heaviest travelled, and the average time users' are renting the bikes. We would like the application users to be able to request service of bikes at a specific dock as well as be able to track their usage of the ISU Bikes, ie. When, How long, Where, etc. These items are important for the user as well as the administrators for the project. The anonymous collection of data will help to provide information about the growth of the project and funding. Also, as required by Iowa State it is necessary that all security measures are met for reading the ISU cards and possible use of the phone application in an existing Iowa State Application.  </p>
