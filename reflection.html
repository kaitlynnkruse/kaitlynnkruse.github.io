                <h3>How has Iowa State prepared me?</h3>
                <p> All of the courses I have taken within my Software Engineering program have given me the fundamentals to be able to design systems and processes. The the core classes have given a good basis and the upper level electives have allowed me to expand on my knowledge of system design and process design. This degree program has included many problem solving courses that have be preparing me for my career after graduation. </p>

                <h3>What have I done at Iowa State to prepare myself?</h3>
                <p> The courses that I have taken at Iowa State have provided me a lot of experience with working in groups. Group work has been a fundamental component of my Software Engineering program at Iowa State. The group work has included projects of anywhere from 2 to 7 people. The different group projects have given me valuable experience that I will be able to apply in the workplace once I graduate. Throughtout my coursework I have had the opportunity to be a part of lectures and discussions regarding professional and ethical responsibilities. I feel I have been well informed of different issues that arise with professional and ethical responsibilities as well as the role that we as Software Engineers hold in keeping these responsibilities. </p>

                <h3> In class projects and problem solving tasks, did you draw upon information, research, or experiences beyond what was provided in class to successfully complete your work? </h3>
                <p> Throughtout my different class projects and assignments I was able to find to go beyond the classroom for information to help solve my problems. Some of the ways I gained expeeerience byehond the classroom was through both of my interships as well as previous projects and assignments. I utilized the internet to do research for topics that I didn't understand or wanted to gain a more detailed understanding of. </p>

                <hr>

                <h3> How did learning activities outside of the classroom (required 124.5 credits) – such as Student Orgs, Career or Study Abroad Fairs, Undergraduate Research Experience (REU), or other university programs – help you to understand the importance of Lifelong Learning? </h3>
                <p> I had the opportunity to do a semester abroad in Singapore at Nanyang Technological University. This opportunity was an amazing experience. I enjoyed the chance to take Computer Engineering modules in a different educational environment. This has shown me the importantce of lifelong learning in education and cultures. I have also been a part of the Society of International Engineers for the past two years. This has been one of the biggest influences on me throughout my time at Iowa State. I have been able to continually learn new things from international exchange students, ISU students that have studied abroad, and ISU students looking to study abroad. Also, I have taken on the role of the SIE Student Advisor this semester, this has given me the opportunity to network with more faculty, guest speakers, and even more students. </p>

                <hr>

                <h3> Have you started to undertake any new learning to improve your ability to apply skills or knowledge to new problems and to develop confidence in taking risks?</h3>
                <p> I feel that I have developed confidence in taking risks and applying my skills and knowledge to everyday problems from my internship and work experiences, course work, organizations, and my study abroad experience. I feel that I have learned an incredible amount of information throughout the past 5 years at Iowa State. I see that not everything can be learned in the classroom and that is why it is important to get involved with groups and organizations outside of class as well as have internship experience. </p>

                <h3> In the context of the first four questions, if you were to do your undergraduate work again, what things would you change? </h3>
                <p> I have often think that I wish that I didn't spend almost two years as a Biology major, but I also think that I have learned many different problem solving skills from this. I don't think that there is anything that I would change about my undergraduate work. I am very happy with where I am at with my major and involvement. </p>
