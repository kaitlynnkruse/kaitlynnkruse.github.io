                <h3>Fit Squared Application and Website</h3>
                <p>Description: This is a Android app that consists of many two main components: food and fitness tracking. The fitness 
                component has the capability to track a users workout and give statistics for the user about their run.  The last main feature of the application is a challenge, the user can challenge another person to a specific workout by sending a request. The Android application is paired with a website for convienient viewing of all the fitness and nutrition statistics. For the design of the Android app there was a database server connection to access the necessary user and food/exercise information. The website also included a more overview of the challenge aspect of the project. The user could see the different challenges that they are a part of as well as their current and top lists of friends. There was signifigant amounts of database manipulation to make some of these aspects of the project work, which has been useful in the overall understanding and usage of database server systems in applications.     
                </p>

                <p>Technologies: The website utilized php for the database server connection and the overall design. On the Android Application and within the website we integrated Google maps with the Google API. We used MySQL for the Database design. 
                </p> 
                
                <p>My Task: My task was the nutrition component for the Android Application. This task included a feature to scan food labels and give the user information regarding the label. Then from here the daily/weekly/monthly statistics view for the user.
                </p> 
                
                <p>Group Strengths: The group that I was a part of worked very well together. We sub divided tasks very efficiently and stayed on tasks. We used a repositiory to share the code and communication channels to stay up to date with all the members of the group.

                <h3>"Mars Rover" Robot</h3>
                <p>Description: This project was to program a robot to be able to navigate through an obstacle course. The obstacle
                course consisted of a border and objects and pits to avoid. The iRobot Create had to avoid contact with specific objects, avoid holes in the ground, and stay within a bounded area. The end zone had to be detectable by the iRobot by means of it knowing it is between four pillars. Signals had to be set to begin the obstacle course and determine end zone. The users of this iRobot were fully dependent on the attachments used to determine the next course of action. The sensors detemined if there were obstructions ahead or if forward movement was ok. The sonar was used to determine locations and distances from obstructions. From here the program determined if the endzone was near, obstructions lay ahead, or it was safe to move forward.  This embedded systems project was a good opportunity to learn about embedded systems and the design of embedded system programs. </p>

                <p>My Task: My task was to work on the ir sensors to determine when the robot was nearing the out of bounds area. I also worked on the the sonar to detect distance from an object. 
                </p> 

                <p>Technology: This project was coded in C using AVR Studio. The commands to the iRobot were sent over Bluetooth to handle all of these cases. The attachments that were used with the iRobot to create this program were sonar, ir sensors, servo, and LCD. The ir sensor was utilized to determine whether or not the iRobot was within the required bounds.
                </p> 

                <p>Group Strengths: This was a four person group. We divided up tasks by fundamental items that needed to get done. We split off into two groups to better handle our time and work on things with one another. We seet up a group chat channel so that we could constantly stay in contact with all members of the group.

                <h3>Register File</h3>
                <p>Description: This is the design of a 4-bit wide 16-register file. This was implemented on an Altera DE2 Board. The board accepts manual inputs from the boards' switches for the read address, write register address, write data, and write enable.   </p>

                <p>My Task:  My task was to design the wiring and design of the register file. This included many tests throughout the design to ensure as components were added they worked as to make sure not to break existing work. The user for this program owould set the write enable, write register address, and write data then check that it is correctly being set and read within the appropriate read address.</p>

                <p>Technology: The outputs are to the 7-segment displays available on the Altera DE2 Board. The coding for this was in Verilog. </p>

                <p>Group Strength: This was an idividual project. I worked soley by myself for the design of this register file. In order to stay on target with my time I planned times to work in the lab and I started the project early and kept working on it versus putting it off a while. </p>
